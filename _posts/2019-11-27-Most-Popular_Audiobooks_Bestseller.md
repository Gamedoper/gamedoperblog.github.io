# A Walk to Remember - Nicholas spark

| It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. A quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her schoolbooks, Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from other teens. She took care of her widowed father, rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out. Landon never would have dreamed of it. Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon Carter's life would never be the same. Being with Jamie would show him the depths of the human heart and lead him to a decision so stunning it would send him irrevocably on the road to manhood.| <a href="https://www.amazon.in/A-Walk-to-Remember/dp/B079TLTZTH/ref=as_li_ss_il?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1574848752&sr=8-3&linkCode=li3&tag=truthfullveno-21&linkId=e01d8684b3b72ecfb743a9e9846de769&language=en_IN" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-in.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B079TLTZTH&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=IN&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=truthfullveno-21&language=en_IN" ></a><img src="https://ir-in.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=truthfullveno-21&language=en_IN&l=li3&o=31&a=B079TLTZTH" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />|

# The Emperor’s New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics - Sir Roger Penrose

For decades, proponents of artificial intelligence have argued that computers will soon be doing everything that a human mind can do. Admittedly, computers now play chess at the grandmaster level, but do they understand the game as we do? Can a computer eventually do everything a human mind can do?  In this absorbing and frequently contentious book, Roger Penrose–eminent physicist and winner, with Stephen Hawking, of the prestigious Wolf prize–puts forward his view that there are some facets of human thinking that can never be emulated by a machine. Penrose examines what physics and mathematics can tell us about how the mind works, what they can’t, and what we need to know to understand the physical processes of consciousness.  He is among a growing number of physicists who think Einstein wasn’t being stubborn when he said his “little finger” told him that quantum mechanics is incomplete, and he concludes that laws even deeper than quantum mechanics are essential for the operation of a mind. | <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Emperors-New-Mind-Concerning-Computers/dp/B07YBK96TC/ref=as_li_ss_il?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1574850238&sr=8-3&linkCode=li3&tag=truthfullveno-21&linkId=f55671b8b494a188e1c9199fa29da163&language=en_IN" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-in.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B07YBK96TC&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=IN&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=truthfullveno-21&language=en_IN" ></a><img src="https://ir-in.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=truthfullveno-21&language=en_IN&l=li3&o=31&a=B07YBK96TC" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> |
