You can play your selected software instrument using musical typing or the on screen keyboard. You can also use a music keyboard.
Different music keyboards have different levels of “sensitivity.” 


A keyboard’s sensitivity affects how hard you have to press the keys on the keyboard to play the highest velocity level of a software instrument. If you use a music keyboard to play software instruments, you can increase the keyboard sensitivity so that playing softer produces higher velocity levels, or decrease the keyboard sensitivity so that higher velocity levels require playing harder.
If you have a computer with windows 7, 

you can play the software instrument on the selected software instrument track using the Keyboard screen and play the alphabetical keys with instruments on the display screen.
